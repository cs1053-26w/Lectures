# Lecture 2 Problems

1. Recall that $f \otimes w$ means cross-correlating image $f$ with filter $w$. Compute the following cross-correlation using **same** output size and **zero** padding.
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 1 & 0\\
     0 & 1 & 0\\
     0 & 1 & 0
   \end{bmatrix} \otimes
   \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 & 1\\
     2 & 4 & 2\\
     1 & 2 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$
   
2. Perform the same convolution as above, but use **repeat** padding.

3. Perform the same convolution as above, but use **valid** output size.

4. Describe in words the result of applying the following filter using cross-correlation. If you aren't sure, try applying it to the image above to gain intuition.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 1\\
  0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

5. Compute the following convolution, assuming **repeat** padding and **same** output size.
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 1\\
     0 & 0 & 1\\
     0 & 1 & 1
   \end{bmatrix} *
   \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 0\\
     1 & 0 & -1\\
     0 & 0 & 0
   \end{bmatrix} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \  & \ & \ \\
     \ & \ & \ \\
     \hspace{1em} & \hspace{1em} & \hspace{1em}
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

6. Will the answer to #5 change if you use the following non-square filter instead?
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & -1\\
     \end{bmatrix}
   $$

7. Design a 5x5 convolution filter that shifts an image up by one pixel then applies a width-3 box blur. Would the filter differ if you blurred before shifting?

8. Does blurring then sharpening an image yield the original, unfiltered image?

9. Compute a 3x3 filter by convolving the following $1 \times 3$ filter with its transpose using **full** output size and zero padding:
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 & 1\\
     \end{bmatrix}
   $$

10. Suppose you have an  image $F$ and you want to apply a $3 \times 3$ filter $H$ that can be written as $H = G * G^T$, where $G$ is $1 \times 3$. Which of the following will be more efficient?

    * $F * (G * G^T)$ 
    * $(F * G) * G^T$

11. For each of the following, decide whether it's possible to design a convolution filter that performs the given operation.

    1. Max filter: the output pixel is the maximum value among the pixels in the input window

    2. Threshold: the output pixel is

       * 1.0 if the input pixel is > 0.5

       * 0.0 otherwise

    3. $y$ partial derivative: the output is a finite-differences approximation of the input image's vertical derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}  f(x, y)$.
