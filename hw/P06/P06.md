# Lecture 6 Problems

For each transformation pictured below, find a 2x2 transformation matrix that maps the original (left) image's coordinates to the corresponding point in the right image. In all cases, the right image's (0, 0) point is at the bottom left corner of the image (bottom corner of the image, in the case of #3.) Also in all images, $x$ points right and $y$ points up.

1. Scale uniformly by a factor of 1.3:

2. Scale by a factor of 2 in only the $x$ direction:

3. Skew or *shear* the image so the top row of pixels is shifted over by 1/4 of the image's <s>width</s> height.

4. Rotate the image counter-clockwise by 30 degrees:

5. Shift the image up and to the right by 40 pixels. You'll need to use a 3x3 matrix for this one!
