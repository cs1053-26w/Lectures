# Lecture 15 Problems - Solutions

1. 
    Storage space - e.g., voxels are expensive
    
    "Learnability" or "optimizability"
    
    Discrete vs continuous
    
    Probably others

2. 
    ```python
    delta = np.ones(10)
    delta[9] = 1e9 # make last delta is huge, since t_11 is conceptually far away
    sigma = np.zeros(10)
    sigma[3:6] = 0.4
    
    T = np.array([np.exp(-np.sum(sigma[:i-1]*delta[:i-1])) for i in range(1,11)])
    a = np.array([1 - np.exp(-sigma[i-1] * delta[i-1]) for i in range(1,11)])
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(range(1,11),T*a)
    ```
