# Lecture 15 Problems

1. Give two important design considerations when thinking about how to represent a 3D scene that is being reconstructed from 2D images. In other words, what properties are useful in a 3D representation, or what are some of the trade-offs?

2. The somewhat obfusque equation used in NeRF for weighting samples along a volume rendering ray is:
   $$
   C(𝐫)=\int_{t_n}^{t_f}T(t)\sigma(𝐫(t))𝐜(𝐫(t),𝐝)dt
   $$
   

   in its continuous form, and the discretized quadriture equation is:
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   \hat{C}(𝐫) &= \sum_{i=1}^N w_i 𝐜_i \\
   					 &=\sum_{i=1}^{N}T_i(1-\text{exp}(-\sigma_iδ_i))𝐜_i
   \end{align*}
   $$
   where N is the number of samples, $T_i=\text{exp}(-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\sigma_jδ_j)$, and $δ_i=t_{i+1}-t_i$ is the distance between adjacent samples. This boils down to a weighted sum of the colors ($\mathbf{c}_i$) along the sample ray.

   To get some intuition for this, let's plug in a simple case and plot the weights. Let's take samples at $t = 1..10$ and assume that the density is 0 except for an constant-density object with density $\sigma= 0.4$ ranging between $t=4$ and $t=6$ inclusive. Using software of your choice, plug this situation into the above equation to compute the weights $w_{1..10}$, and plot these to show the weights on the 10 different sample points.
